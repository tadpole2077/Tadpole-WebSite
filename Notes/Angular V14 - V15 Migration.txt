Main Run (note check prerequisites within angular guide first && select 'I use Angular Material'):
	Commit files to Git
	Angular upgrade 14.2.11 to 15.2.9,  + Materials + medium complexity
	ng update @angular/core@15 @angular/cli@15
	ng update @angular/material@15

	npm i @swimlane/ngx-charts@20.3.0 https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swimlane/ngx-charts



Potential Code change:
> (Potential CSS Impact - as in use) In v15, the Angular compiler prefixes @keyframes in CSS with the component's scope. 
  This means that any TypeScript code that relies on keyframes names no longer works in v15. Update any such instances to: define keyframes programmatically, use global stylesheets, or change the component's view 
  encapsulation. Read further https://angular.io/guide/update-to-version-15#v15-bc-03

> In Angular Material v15
  Many of the components have been refactored to be based on the official Material Design Components for Web (MDC). 
  This change affected the DOM and CSS classes of many components. Read further https://rc.material.angular.io/guide/mdc-migration

> In your application's tsconfig.json file, remove enableIvy. In v15, Ivy is the only rendering engine so enableIvy is not required.


> In Angular version 15, the deprecated `relativeLinkResolution` config parameter of the Router is removed.
  This migration removes all `relativeLinkResolution` fields from the Router config objects.
  Migration completed (No changes made).

> Since Angular v15, the `RouterLink` contains the logic of the `RouterLinkWithHref` directive.
  This migration replaces all `RouterLinkWithHref` references with `RouterLink`.
  Migration completed (No changes made).

WEB 3

	npm i web3@4.0.1

	[2023/10/20] Updated Packages:
	npm i web3@4.2.0  
	Using Packages:
		web3-core
		web3-utils
		web3.eth
		web3-validator
	[2023/10/23] Problem :  using method.send() with any arguments,  reverting back to V4.0.1 works.


	[2024/05/06] Updated Packages:
	npm i web3@4.7

	Notes:  Supports Multi-Wallet EIP-6963 - resolves race condition when using multiple wallets.  Issue with Tron extension using Ethereum DOM object interferance with Metamask usage.


	Updates:  web3 4.x : rewritten in typescript and is strongly typed.




======================================================================================
Bootstrap 5 components in use:
1) navbar  :  Main navigation top toolbar + mobile responsiveness  
2) ngbDropdown : Dropdown lists  >> 
	District List
	Account List
	World List

3) A lot of the base page styles
4) possibly more - to test drop : angular.json > node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css

MOVING AWAY:
If moving away from bootstrap - Start with ngbDropdown, transition to another Material V3 drop down list
Until then pain points as managing material styles + bootstrap combined.  A lot of extra css to tweak it to work.  
Centralise those tweaks to allow easiler migration and removal on future release.

	Read more : 
	- https://goo.gle/state-of-e2e-in-angular
	- By Angular V16 : Protractor is fully deprecated, use 3 alternative e2e (end-to-end) testing solutions.

	Final Analysis:
	- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/25298
	- No action required, on upgrade to V16 it will be removed.  
	- Protractor should only be used within development environment for testing E2E.
